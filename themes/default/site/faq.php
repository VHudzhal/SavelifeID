             It&apos;s a service that allows you to access your medical profiles,
              instantly, particularly in emergency situations. By scanning the QR
              code with the phone or tapping the NFC tag with an NFC enabled
              phone, or logging into the service on the website, you can access
              your medical profile 24/7. You have a choice to carry a card and/or
              bracelet with a QR code and embedded NFC chip to tap. This will
              enable you to share critical medical information to emergency first
              responders and medical personnel when you need it most.

             The subscriber allows his full or customized emergency profile to
              be made viewable to anyone scanning the QR code or tapping the
              NFC tag. This is intended for emergency use because it is a subset
              of the full medical profile.

             <br><br>The full medical profile, maintained by the subscriber or received
              directly from the participating physician@apos;s electronic health record
              system, is accessible 24/7 by logging into the subscriber account

             The SaveLifeID service is available everywhere there is internet

                whose electronic health records may be directly uploaded to the
                SaveLifeID platform are available in the New York City area but we
                plan on expanding nationally over time.

             Emergency contact information originates from your existing
              medical record or you may enter one or more contacts yourself.
              You can update these contacts anytime by logging into your profile
              on the SaveLifeID site. In case of emergency, your contact(s) will
              be informed by text and/or email when the QR code on the card or
              bracelet is scanned or the embedded NFC tag is tapped.
              SaveLifeID encourages you to regularly review the contact
              information to keep it current.

             That&apos;s easy. If you want to add, correct, or change information you
              entered just login into your SaveLifeID account and update your
              medical profile at any time.
            <br><br>If you joined the service through your physician, your medical
              information is managed by your physician&apos;s Electronic Medical
              Record system. You can review your profile anytime online to see
              what needs to be updated or corrected.
            <br><br>Then inform the doctor&apos;s office and they will update the profile.
              That change will be reflected usually within hours on SaveLife ID.
